        <h1>Good Kid</h1>
<p>Good Kid is a five-member indie pop/pop punk band from Toronto. Good Kid consists of five members: lead vocalist Nick Frosst, drummer Jon Kereliuk, bassist Michael Kozakov, and guitarists David Wood and Jacob Tsafatinos. The band's mascot, known as Nomu Kid, is primarily featured in their marketing and social media.</p>

<h2>Why I like them</h2>

<p>The reason I like them is that they are very simple with their music and its really calm when you dont want something too fast or to slow. Also their background music and music in general sounds very similar which, if you like 1 song, you would probably like others.</p>
